# flipkart_data_scraping

In this project I scraped one of the popular e-commerce websites Flipkart using beautifulsoup

I tried to get the details of mobile phones of some selected brands.

you can find the code in flipkart_data.py and the scraped data in flip_data.csv file

You may not be able to get the exact same dataset even if you run this code due to new mobiles being added and recomendation system of Flipkart.

Later I cleaned the dataset and made it useful for analysis.

Then I performed EDA on the data using different visualization techniques.

Finally dumped the data into flip_data_cleaned.csv file.
