# flipkart_data_scraping

In this project we tried to scrape one of the popular e-commerce websites Flipkart using beautifulsoup

we tried to get the details of mobile phones of some selected brands.

you can find the code in flipkart_data.py anf the scraped data in flip_data.csv file

You may not be able to get the exact same dataset even if you run this code due to new mobiles being added and recomendation system of Flipkart.
