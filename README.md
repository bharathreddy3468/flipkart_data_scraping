# Endtoend Flipkart Mobile Price Prediction

I embarked on a journey to understand the mobile phone market by focusing on some selected brands available on Flipkart. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what I accomplished:

Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup 🕸️

Scraped mobile phone details using Python's BeautifulSoup library.
The data scraping code is available in flipkart_data.py.
